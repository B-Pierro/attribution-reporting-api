# Notes

Flex lite update:

David Dabbs: The flex lite seems in progress (both spec and eng). Which milestone do you intend to land? 

Charlie Harrison: We haven’t documented it in a single place. Structuring the explainer in two phases (lite and full). Gives a stable set of deliverables for the intermediate version. We think that it (lite version?) will hit stable or testing before the full version is out. The implementation is underway. We have a week if we want it to get in the Chrome 117 branch. So flex-lite might be in Chrome 117 (stable in September) if all reviewing work is done in time, otherwise it should be in 118 (stable in October). For the full-spec, the specification is not ready yet.

David Dabbs: It looks like the lite version does not introduce any breaking change

Charlie Harrison: we are trying to not introduce any breaking changes. The only one is documented in [issue 765](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/765). The full flex allows you to pick and choose any value for the metadata, but this breaks the modulus operation which is done to restrict the values in the current API. This difference should be fairly minor.

David Dabbs: you can change only windows or number of reports?

Charlie Harrison: the difference between the lite and the full proposal is that you can change the number of windows per trigger events (?). In the lite proposal, the configuration is fixed.

Lookback window support ([https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/914](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/914))

Charlie Harrison: Just wanted to point out this PR. The idea is that right now conversion filters do not have first-class support for time constraints. Here we can support per trigger type various attribution window. With the current API, you can do this, but it should be quite complicated (using strings, etc). Please have a look!

David Dabbs: with the current API with the data filters, it is last touch. 

Charlie: we do the matching based on priority and then do last touch.

David Dabbs: if you have a destination site which have different brands, but you run campaigns that do attribution based differently on brands, but this is a different problem.

Charlie: Please see [https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/523](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/523). There might be a privacy problem with implementing it in the reverse (if you do filtering first and then do the priority). The privacy problem can be quite tricky.

Alois: Question regarding the general availability of the API. Switch slated to happen in M116? Added some settings for the user in the EU to opt-out of the API. Wondering about the intended behavior of the API in this context. Tested the activation of the API, surprised to see we get some pings for source / trigger registration. Sources with attributionsrc. For sources I was a bit surprised. Some remarks in the PATCG about the intended default behavior of the measurement API. Should the status of the API be available to the website?
