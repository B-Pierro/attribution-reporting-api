# Notes


## FLEDGE + ARA integration

Charlie:



* [https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/289](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/289) 
* Register agg reports from FLEDGE
* Mix the pub context, auction context (generateBid) and fenced frame context (user interaction)
* To do that: give generateBid access to a new API so you can register a pending source
* Same structure as existing ARA headers, but as JSON
* With this the fenced frames can measure user activity and register the associated agg keys for those actions.
* Open Q:
    * Is this doable without many new complex API surfaces? E.g. use headers?
    * 3P measurement providers may be tricky to support with the proposed approach. **If you have insights/suggestions to support that ue case, please chime in on that bug.**

Alois: 



* Great to see some work at the intersection of FLEDGE and ARA
* There are some use cases that should be covered by [PAA](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-aggregation-api)
* Would be great to see some unification between these API surfaces

Charlie:



* Distinction between the two APIs:
    * PAA: more focused, JS-only API—best for win reporting, loss reporting etc. We're working on enhancements there, extending functionality for FLEDGE integration.
    * ARA:

Brian:



* The gist of FLEDGE is that pub shouldn't have any idea what interest groups are being shown for their website, is that correct?

Charlie: 



* Not entirely correct, we want to prevent info to be shared at an individual event's level, we also don't want the buyer to know that a user saw a certain ad. In aggregate, this is OK to share though. This is a core use case for FLEDGE users. Buyers do want to know the sites their ads are shown on.
* There's a temporary event-level FLEDGE reporting, but long-term we want things to be as aggregate as possible.

Christina:



* In order for billing to work in the short term, event-level is important for FLEDGE.
* FLEDGE integration open Q both for PAA and ARA: How much event-level info are we comfortable with? What's strictly necessary?

Brian:



* Would it work to have event-level reporting from the FLEDGE context to the advertiser?

Charlie:



* FLEDGE context could mean a few things:
    * Auction context (multiple sites)
    * Fenced frames context
    * Report win context

Brian:



* This would be useful if we could abstract individual user-level info out of that without using aggregatable reports, e.g. bid price, ad etc.

Charlie:



* Let's discuss that in existing issues e.g. [https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/281](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/issues/281) 


## Developer guides

Charlie:

We don't yet have a lot of info for optimal methods on querying and dealing with noise. Would more (mathematically) detailed developer guides be useful?



* How to split your budget
* Optimization when using hierarchical keys…

Brian:



* It would be useful but you may lose quite some of your audience
* A less in-depth version that addresses general use cases would be helpful. I want to know "ballpark" how I should think about these things.

Alois:



* We'd be happy to get further guides / what's your take on using these APIs
* Atm we're not clear on what's possible with the aggregation API and what should be possible in the future
    * Wildcard queries proposal would enable many more use cases for example
    * The current API is restrictive and unusable in its current state

Charlie:



* So, more flexibility in how we can query the system?

Alois:



* Yes

Charlie:



* This sounds more like a roadmap question.

Amandeep:



* +1 to getting more developer guides
* Guides so far have been extremely helpful
* More general use cases

Maud:



* Wanted to ask, I think it would be helpful to have these listed somewhere on the sorts of use-cases you’d like some details, maybe we could have an issue documenting this.

Brian:



* Follow along with what Amandeep said, there’s going to be different levels of development. People putting together this stuff to get added to a report, and other people trying to understand implications of setting various configurations.

Charlie:



* Different audiences => different levels we could be approaching these things

Brian:



* Guides are tactical, get more strategic

Christina:



* Two different aspects:
    * There's a lot of things that already exist today in adtech, and that you'd like to adapt
    * And there's "if you tried to start an adtech business today, how would you approach that?"

Brian:



* Need to understand Chrome's vision for ARA, and I want to know how my system fits into ARA.


## Service worker registration

[https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/550](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/550)

Charlie: 



* Open bugs in the spec: 
    * We don't support registrations for fetches that were initiated in service workers
    * When the SW responds with this request, it wrongly uses the URL from the first request
* => If you're redirecting and these get intercepted by SWs, you'll see buggy behaviors. If you've seen losses on pages that heavily uses SWs, that may be the reason.
* These are fixed but we still need to align our spec with the SW spec.
* Do we want the SW to rewrite the headers, or do we want this API to work exclusively on the network layer?

Sid:



* What about the top level context change with service workers?

Charlie:



* There's a plan alongside network partitioning where SW cache will also be partitioned by top level context => that's across different eTLD+1
* We'll need to experiment and assess breakage
* This brings along the benefit where SWs have knowledge of the top level context (without this, it'd be hard to support responses from requests initiated by SWs—there's a workaround though until we get SW fetches that are themselves dependent on cache partitioning: you could say in your SW registration to not intercept conversion or impression pings)


## FYI: Decouple Impression Expiry and Reporting window for Event level Attribution API

Charlie:



* [https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/522](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/522)
* [https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/556](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/pull/556)
* We added an aggregatable expiry field (backwards compatible): adds more flexibility if you want to have separate expiries

Brian:



* What are the consequences of different expiries? Re: conversation we had earlier, that type of info would be helpful.


## Misc

Brian:



* Destination site limit: [https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/482](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/482) 
* What are the implications of that?

Charlie:



* This is about the # of advertisers you're listing for source registration. It's orthogonal to 3P meas providers that'll show up in the redirect chain.
* For every separate reporting origin, you have top 100 pending impressions for a given advertiser 
* That limit is not shared across reporting origins
* We people to move that to something that's purely time-bounded: we'll keep track of the # of advertisers you're registering in a given time window. Benefit: we don't have to look at the browser storage; the restriction is not based on cross-site info; so we feel more strongly that we can report errors about this (otherwise there may be a leak of cross site data). 
* We're assessing how often these limits are hit in practice and it seems incidence is low, but **let us know if you think that may impact your use case**.  

Brian:



* If a 3P adtech (reporting origin) works with a lot of people and hits their limit and is first in the redirect chain, what happens?

Charlie:



* This should be independent 
* We won’t fail ad-tech further down the chain

Brian: How would we deal with reconciliation in that case?

Charlie: Since we are designing an error reporting mechanism we might be able to have affected ad-tech at least know they have truncated data and report an asterisk to the advertiser, and also fix any misconfigured use of the API

Brian: Let’s be careful about introducing asterisks because they can be abused (e.g. ad-tech reporting asterisks maliciously)
