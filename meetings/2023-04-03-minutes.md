# Notes

Topic 1 - [Chandan Giri] Updating reporting windows for event-level reports ([issue 736](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/736)); Related to [issue #730](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/730)



*   Chandan: current window, 2day, 7day, source expiry
*   Based on OT data: Most of the conversion happen within 1hr;
    *   Challenges:
        *   With current window -- long delay; 
        *   There is user deletion that happens overtime. 
        *   Weekend effect -- longer delay if the user is not active
    *   → Proposal: first window to 1hr
    *   To avoid waiting for 7days for rest of the conversions: bring back window to 2d
    *   Keep the last one as-is.
*   Brian: 
    *   Weekend effect makes sense; weekday vs weekend persona in terms of delay. Weekend persona disappears for a week.
*   Chanda: 
    *   Thursday has the highest delays
*   John:
    *   Makes sense to optimize for fastest delivery (for browse + ad tech) 
    *   Flexible event configuration addresses part of this
    *   Related to [issue#730](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/730)
*   Akash
    *   Planning to test alternative reporting windows in non-stable channels
    *   [issue#730](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/730) lists the testing proposal
    *   Looking for feedback on what windows to test, and proposal
*   John:
    *   Are there any viable windows to test? Want to get Chrome metrics on this.
*   Amandeep Aggarawal
    *   Use-cases and proposal makes sense
    *   This is for click-through. For view-through, they wait until expiration. How 
*   Chandan:
    *   You have 1 window for VTC, so you can configure different windows and test
    *   Seeing value for setting this lower
*   Amandeep
    *   If this is set for a small window (~2 day / 1hrs), you will lose conversion. Tradeoff is latency to receive vs. number of reports. Can set it per user.
*   John:
    *   [issue#730](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/730) is asking for feedback on views too.
*   Brian May
    *   Regardless of window chosen, there will be data loss
    *   Any plan for server-side component to cache the reports and then forward them to the adtech?
*   John
    *   Discussed this on aggregate API, e.g. for removing IP address. Can apply to event data loss too.
    *   High bar entry (compared to client side). May look into this in the long term.

Topic 2 - [John Delaney] Reducing delays for aggregatable reports ([issue 738](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/738))



*   John:
    *   Similar challenges to event-level. 
    *   Any delay on the client leads to longer delays due to user being offline
    *   Aggregate has additional challenges due to limits of disjoint batches; impact whether you can even measure
    *   The issue presents an update
        *   0-10min delay (instead of 10-60min delay)
        *   Relies on null reporting; at trigger time, generate fake report at x% of the time; indistinguishable from a real report, but doesn’t contribute to summary report; allows hiding the true count of reports.
        *   Challenge: source registration time is in the report. This is difficult to mimic, because of additional noise required.
            *   Mitigation: allow ad tech to configure whether source\_registration\_time in report.
            *   If you don’t include the field, less null reports (5%)
            *   If you include source\_registration\_time (25%)
            *   This is done to maintain same privacy parameters 
            *   Source registration can be useful, so we want to allow it.
*   Alois Bissuel
    *   Very useful to reduce delay; user less likely to shutdown the device within 10min compared with 60min
    *   We want to use source\_registration\_time to support multiple attribution window; could drop it, if we could re-process reports in the aggregation service
*   Brian May:
    *   Could source registration be less granular?
*   Alois
    *   It’s already rounded to 1 day; unclear what’s possible
    *   How do you decide on the trade-off on source registration vs. noise? 
*   John:
    *   Delay report time will be consistent; you can trade-off between source registration and null report
    *   Not planning to allow delay configuration
*   Alois
    *   How do you balance privacy vs. paratmers?
*   John
    *   Charlie wil be able to answer more fully
    *   One-sided DP bound
    *   Including source time increases the domain; we want to try to maintain same epsilon; will include in the explainer on the claim of picking this noise level
*   Brian May:
    *   We would see time-of-day biases of activity;
    *   Might be good to look at overall activity to account for delay
    *   If we can’t observe some times, ad techs may focus on more measurable time 
*   John
    *   Makes sense to look into user activity 
    *   Should look into how long the browser is run after a conversion. We expect difference in behavior between desktop and mobile, and across OS
    *   As part of #730, we’ll have a good idea on what’s the real impact of 0-10 delay
*   Renan
    *   To Alois’ comment on re-running reports in aggregation service, head this feedback from multiple sources; thinking of how to support; no immediate plans

Topic 3 - [Alois Bissuel] [Issue 734](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/734): [Event-level] Noise level and intermediate reporting windows



*   Alois
    *   Currently, noise level for clicks is fixed at 0.24%; this matches a long reporting window.
    *   But if you use a shorter reporting window (e.g. 1 day), to maintain the same privacy parameters, the noise level required is much lower.
    *   Charlie acknowledged this
*   John
    *   There are two existing ways to configure the reporting window. To confirm, when you adjust the windows, do you want less noise?
*   Alois
    *   Yes, you effectively get a lower noise when you have less intermediary windows.
*   John:
    *   +1 to Charlie’s 
    *   Implementation shouldn’t be too complicated; we already have an output state generator; it should be doable. 
    *   Similar to [flexible event configuration](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/flexible_event_config.md); we will discuss this in the next meeting
*   Chandan
    *   +1 to this idea; this makes a lot of sense and very sharp

Topic 4 - [Akash Nadan][ Issue 725](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/725) & [Issue 661](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/661) Per reporting site rate limits



*   Akash
    *   Flagging this again, as we would appreciate feedback before moving forward
    *   [Issue 661](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/661): moving existing limits from reporting origin to reporting site; increase in privacy 
    *   [Issue 725](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/725): new rate limit; increase in privacy
*   Alois
    *   725 - is sensible. 
    *   Can we have a unified definition of all these definitions (incl. with FLEDGE)? It’s get very confusing when you interact with all APIs. 
    *   Have you looked at the other APIs to look for consistency?
*   Akash 
    *   Good feedback. Need to look at this more and follow-up
