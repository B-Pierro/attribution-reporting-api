# Notes



* Criteo to present “Use cases and principles for Attribution/Measurement proposals” [https://github.com/patcg/proposals/issues/14](https://github.com/patcg/proposals/issues/14) 

Thomas:



* Document describing a framework to evaluate various APIs
* First use-case is billing, need to ensure APIs let us bill properly for DSP, to ensure publishers get paid correct. 
* Should have a third party be able to get access to billing data so these can be cross referenced
* For reporting, important to measure: campaign, product, device type, ad characteristics (size), info about the click, etc.
    *  bid win rate, yield, number of displays, user exposure, click-through rate, attributed visits, attributed sales, etc.
* Monitoring and incident detection:
    * Need in real-time to detect incidents / bugs in the measurement flow
    * Incidents can result in spending money that wasn’t intended

John:



*  Useful set of use-cases, that span across different APIs

Lionel:



* Maybe won’t need an API most of the time for some of these use cases.
* Will certainly need an APi to measure cross-site data, e.g. Attribution. But for normal display counting / etc, we do not need a dedicated APi unless showing ads with some restrictions like FLEDGE.

Brian:



* Seems like a number of these use-cases could be solved by server-to-server with some intermediary.
* Would be good to identify which of these require a browser and which do not

Lionel:



* We would like to convert this github issue into a document

Brian:



* Have you looked at any of the other use-case document put out in the other W3 fora?

Lionel:



* Yes, wanted to have a higher level view with better coverage. If there are any use-cases missing from other available documents happy to add them. Many of the proposals focus on specific use cases, wanted better coverage of the proposals that are out there.

Brian:



* If we can get a list of use-cases which involve the browser, that would be great.

Lionel:



* We can go through the list and analyze which need support without cross-site tracking.

Brian:



* Taking a step back and looking at things from a first principles perspective. Should focus on any problems where the browser can’t be abstracted.


## Getting the publisher domain in the clear in the aggregate API: [https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/583](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/issues/583)

Alois:

Last meeting we discussed calling out any use-cases not fulfilled in the API. We identified an issue with encoding the publisher in the aggregation key. Encoding the domain in the aggregate API presents a lot of challenges.

Propose adding the publisher domain in the clear, which was present in the first iteration of the aggregate API. But adding more contributions with 0 value.

The other way would be for the aggregation service to expose the aggregation keys which we have not thought of at query time. Cannot build a static dictionary once and for all for publishers, as they pop in and pop out.

Chistina:



* It sounds like the primary issue here for usability is that it is difficult to encode the sites properly. Genuinely challenging to encode, and then we have a discovery problem later.

Alois:



* For most use-cases correctly encoding the publisher domain. E.g. if we had 1000 bits of ASCII + a discovery mechanism. For Private Aggregation, we want to be able to quickly identify fraud, e.g. if a click farm gets setup.

Christina:



* Given there are lots of clicks, are there other APIs that could be used for this kind of detection?

Alois:



* Not entirely sure, but in general we want more information to make decisions about fraud

Christina:



* More so trying to understand if aggregate reporting is the first line of defense, e.g. in the bidding flow. Whereas if you are then creating a batch later on and trying to do some filtering.

Alois:



* There are many layers of defense. We have real-time system, e.g. if we get a lot of traffic from an IP. Also want to have some visibility on our reports to do investigation, but not at the end of the month when billing clients.
* I believe some of this for bidding, that part of this could be handled by the Private Aggregation API, so there we may also want more signal.

Brian:



* If we have domain, that makes the aggregation API more useful. Without it, we will look for other ways to cover the use-cases. Do we want to make this APi central to our systems, or do we want to have to use this in parallel with a number of other systems.

John:



*  

Alois:



* Tracking multiple conversion types

Brian:



* Can probably clarify the language here as this is not traditionally deduping (removing duplicate information), but removing redundant information.
